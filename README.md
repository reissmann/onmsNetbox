onmsNetbox
==========

A tool for importing devices from Netbox into OpenNMS.

This tool connects to Netbox using its API, queries for devices to add to
OpenNMS, collects a bunch of information for each of the devices, and finally
creates an OpenNMS requisition.xml configuration, that gets imported into
OpenNMS using its REST-API.

Installation
------------

To install, clone the repository, create a python virtualenv, and install
the python module using setuptools.

    git clone
    cd onmsNetbox
    
    python -m venv ./venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    python setup.py install

Finally, copy the configuration file and the template file.


Configuration
-------------

A configuration file is needed to provide login credentials for opennms, as 
well as an API token for netbox.

The tool will automatically try to load the configuration file from:

   1) /etc/onmsNetbox/config.yaml
   2) <workingDirectory>/config.yaml

Within the configuration file, please provide the following information:

    netbox:
      token:

    opnmnms:
      username:
      password:

Monitoring SNMP-Interfaces
--------------------------

To monitor the interface status of our LAG-Interfaces, the following service
monitor is required in OpenNMS.

    <service name="SNMP-Interface" interval="30000" user-defined="false" status="on">
        <pattern><![CDATA[^SNMP-Interface-(?<iface>.*)]]></pattern>
        <parameter key="oid" value=".1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2.${pattern:iface}"/>
    </service>
    <monitor service="SNMP-Interface" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.poller.monitors.SnmpMonitor"/>
